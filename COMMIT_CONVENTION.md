# Git Commit Message Convention

> This is adapted from [Angular's commit convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/blob/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular/convention.md).

## Examples

Appears under "Features" header, `compiler` subheader:

```
feature(compiler): add 'comments' option
```

Appears under "Bug Fixes" header, `v-model` subheader, with a link to issue #28:

```
fix(v-model): handle events on blur

close #28
```

Appears under "Performance Improvements" header, and under "Breaking Changes" with the breaking change explanation:

```
perf(core): improve vdom diffing by removing 'foo' option

BREAKING CHANGE: The 'foo' option has been removed.
```

## Full Message Format

A commit message consists of a **header**, **body** and **footer**.  The header has a **type**, **scope** and **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

### Type

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, it will appear in the changelog. However if there is any [BREAKING CHANGE](#footer), the commit will always appear in the changelog.

Other prefixes are up to your discretion. Suggested prefixes are `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, and `test` for non-changelog related tasks.

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `core`, `compiler`, `ssr`, `v-model`, `transition` etc...

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, **present tense**: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
